            <td>I am Itachi Uchiha — a web developer who believes perfection lies in simplicity and precision. I write
                code the
                way I once strategized battles — with calm, logic, and purpose. Every project I build carries depth
                beneath its
                clean surface. My goal is not just to create websites, but experiences that speak silently — just like
                my past,
                powerful yet peaceful.</td>
